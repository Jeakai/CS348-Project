- Local DB Setup:
  - Install MySQL Workbench
  - Run createTables.sql

    - /players -> gets all players
    - /teams -> gets all teams
    - /teams/:abbr -> gets a team with abbreviation = abbr
    - /favorites/:id -> gets all favorites for user with uid = id
    - /users/profile -> gets the profile of the user (requires auth token in header)
  - PUT
    - /users/:id -> updates the user with uid = id; requires a body like `{"username": "userName", email: "emailId", "password": "password"}`
    - /favorites/:id/toggle -> toggles favorite (as a transaction) for user with uid = id; requires a body like `{"playerId": "playerId"}`
    - 
  - POST
    - /register -> registers a new user; requires a body like `{"username": "userName", email: "emailId", "password": "password"}`
    - /login -> logs in a user; requires a body like `{"email": "emailId", "password": "password"}`
